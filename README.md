**akanji** is a fun project that uses *p5.js*. The aim of *akanji* is to provide a fun set of visual representation methods when there is environmental sound is enough for the microphone to receive, and meaningful for a human being to observe.

Right now it has a single way of representing sound - which is soundwaves generated by the volume. 

#### What does akanji mean?

Manuel Akanji is a football player in Borussia Dortmund. I'm not very familiar with who he is since he's not a big scorer within the team - I just liked the pronunciation of his name in Turkish.
